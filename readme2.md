### Ripple

Since Ripple, uniquely, can rely only on authentication between the two people making the exchange, this implementation uses authentication only between people, and not between servers.

What this means is, instead of each server authenticating itself via a certificate authority, which requires a centralization of trust (even if a web-of-trust certificate authority is used, it still to some extent centralizes), Ripple can operate with only people with trustlines authenticating themselves to each other.

Practically, this also works well with symmetric keys, which the people exchange in some way. A peer (essentially a trustline, but with some other data too such as shared secret key) is stored in `accounts/your_account/peers/your_peers_account/secret_key.txt`, and the shared secret is stored there as well. The authentication then uses a "message authentication code" alongside the message, and a hash-based message authentication code ("HMAC") will likely be used. Such a signature has theoretically stronger security than an asymmetric signature, and this implementation wants to demonstrate that Ripple can operate with symmetric cryptography only, which is a strenght it has.

This implementation will then use no encryption of the messages. It will use no encryption since encryption isn't strictly needed to run Ripple. It is easy to add.

People also use symmetric authentication with their server, and this is set up by exchanging a shared secret key with the server admin. The key is stored (on the server) in `accounts/your_account/secret_key.txt`, and in the client, in `client_datadir/secret_key.txt`. Besides that, all messages in plaintext. No persistent connection to server needed, craft a message (a command with argments, and your username as parameter), sign it with HMAC, and submit the message and the signature to the server. Asymmetric key could be used too, but the benefit of asymmetric cryptography is in public contexts, and in person-to-person (including person-to-server where its still a personal exchange between two entities) they're not required.
